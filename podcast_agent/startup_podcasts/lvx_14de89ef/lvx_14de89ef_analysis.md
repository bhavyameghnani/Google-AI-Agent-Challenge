## Risk Factors
⚠️ High Valuation & IPO Expectations: The targeted $8 billion IPO valuation is a significant premium over its Series E valuation ($3 billion in 2021), requiring sustained, high-growth performance to justify.
⚠️ Intense Competitive Landscape: The Indian fintech and brokerage space is highly competitive, with established players and new entrants vying for market share, potentially leading to pricing pressures.
⚠️ Rising Attrition Rates: High attrition rates in key teams are a concern, with 50% in customer support and 27.1% in engineering, product, and design during FY25, which could impact operations and development.
⚠️ Regulatory Scrutiny: As a major financial services player, Groww is subject to evolving SEBI and RBI regulations, which could impact its business model or operational costs.
