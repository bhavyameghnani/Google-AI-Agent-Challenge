Avantika: "Welcome to LVX Insights, the podcast where we analyze promising Indian startups for the Let's Venture community. I'm Avantika..."
Hrishikesh: "And I'm Hrishikesh. Today we're diving deep into Zomato... and there's a lot to unpack here, especially given its journey from a startup to a publicly listed giant."

Avantika: "So, let's start with what they actually do. Zomato, you know, it was founded way back in 2008 as FoodieBay by Deepinder Goyal and Pankaj Chaddah, then rebranded in 2010. They're headquartered in Gurugram, India."
Hrishikesh: "Right, and their core mission has always been 'Better food for more people,' evolving into this vision of powering India's changing lifestyles through instant commerce that feels 'indistinguishable from magic.' They started as a restaurant listing service, really, and now they're a full-blown food-tech ecosystem, touching online food delivery, restaurant services, and quick commerce."

Avantika: "Now, let's talk about their key products and some of the more recent launches, because Zomato has been quite active here. Beyond their core food delivery and restaurant discovery, they reintroduced Zomato Gold in 2024, and it's already, quite impressively, attracted over 2 million subscribers by late 2024."
Hrishikesh: "Exactly, Avantika. And that's just one piece. A significant development is their expansion in the 'going-out' segment through the **District** app. This platform, you know, it's aiming to reshape restaurant discovery and event engagement. They've even pushed into live events and ticketing, notably with the substantial acquisition of Paytm's events and ticketing business for ₹2,048 crore in 2024. Plus, they've integrated their quick commerce platform, **Blinkit**, directly into the main Zomato app for faster grocery and essential deliveries, though that did draw some criticism from the restaurant community."
Avantika: "And technologically, they're not standing still, are they?"
Hrishikesh: "Not at all. Zomato heavily leverages AI for personalized recommendations and to enhance delivery efficiency. They're using data analytics, entity embedding, and are even moving towards reinforcement learning to improve user experience and operational logistics."

Avantika: "Switching gears to recent news and developments over the last 3-6 months, what's been making headlines for Zomato?"
Hrishikesh: "Well, they've had some significant recognition. Zomato received the 'Emerging Company of the Year Award' at the ET Awards 2024 in March 2025, which really underscores their growth aspirations, aiming for a $10 billion valuation. They also hosted popular Zomato Restaurant Awards, and the Condé Nast Traveller x District by Zomato Top Restaurant Awards, showing their continued engagement with the industry."
Avantika: "And regulatory-wise, they got some good news, right?"
Hrishikesh: "Yes, in 2024, Zomato was cleared by the Competition Commission of India, the CCI, in an antitrust lawsuit, which is crucial for regulatory clarity. Also, on the ESG front, they made a strong pledge in 2024 to source 100% of their packaging from sustainable materials by 2025, with 70% already recyclable. That's projected to reduce 50,000 tons of carbon emissions annually, and they've even partnered with NGOs to redistribute over 10,000 meals to combat food waste."

Avantika: "Now, let's talk about their latest funding round and, more broadly, their financial health, especially as a public company. What's the picture looking like?"
Hrishikesh: "It's a strong picture, Avantika. They went public in 2021 with a market cap of $13 billion. Prior to that, they'd raised $1.69 billion across 19 rounds. But what's really notable is a post-IPO round on November 28, 2024, where Zomato secured $1 billion from major institutional investors like Fidelity Investments, Temasek, Naspers, and Baillie Gifford. Their current market capitalization stands at approximately ₹2.63 trillion as of late 2025."
Avantika: "And profitability, that's been a big focus, hasn't it?"
Hrishikesh: "Absolutely. Zomato demonstrated impressive financial performance, achieving profitability in FY24 with an adjusted EBITDA of ₹372 crore and a Profit After Tax, or PAT, of ₹1,155 crore. Their annual revenue as of March 31, 2024, was ₹13,000 crore, with adjusted revenue for FY24 at ₹13,545 crore, marking a substantial 56% year-over-year growth. The food delivery business itself is quite profitable, boasting EBITDA margins of 3.4%."
Avantika: "Those are solid numbers. And what about future projections?"
Hrishikesh: "Analysts are certainly bullish, projecting a 55% revenue CAGR for Zomato over FY24-FY27. PAT margins are also expected to see significant growth: 4.3% in FY25, 8.7% in FY26, and an impressive 13.2% in FY27. Even with a general slowdown in the food delivery sector, their Gross Order Value, or GOV, in Q1 FY25 was ₹9,264 crore, rising 2% sequentially to ₹9,913 crore in the October-December quarter, a 17% year-on-year increase."

Avantika: "Speaking of the team, there have been some significant leadership changes recently, haven't there?"
Hrishikesh: "Indeed. Rakesh Ranjan, the CEO of Zomato's food delivery arm, stepped down in April 2025, with Deepinder Goyal, the Group CEO, temporarily taking over those responsibilities. This followed the resignation of Rinshul Chandra, the COO of food delivery, earlier that same month. And co-founder Akriti Chopra, who was Chief People Officer, also resigned in September 2024. These are, of course, things that investors keep a close eye on."
Avantika: "That's quite a reshuffle at the top. But on the flip side, they've also made some strategic hires and reappointments?"
Hrishikesh: "That's right. Shalin Bhatt, for instance, returned in July 2024 to lead their dining-out expansion, which was publicly announced in February 2025. And to bolster the 'going-out' segment, they've appointed Zeenah Vilcassim as CEO of Zomato Live and Kunal Khambhati as COO. They continue active recruitment for various roles, from customer support to business analysts, and their employee count was 6,903 as of March 31, 2025."

Avantika: "Let's turn to the competitive analysis because Zomato operates in a very intense market. Who are their main rivals?"
Hrishikesh: "In India, it's primarily a duopoly with Swiggy in food delivery, commanding over 88% of the market combined. For quick commerce, their Blinkit unit faces intense competition from Zepto and Swiggy Instamart. Globally, you have players like Uber Eats, DoorDash, but they're not directly competing in India."
Avantika: "And how do they stack up in terms of market share?"
Hrishikesh: "As of Q1 FY25, Zomato actually leads India's food delivery market with a 58% share, compared to Swiggy's 42%. In quick commerce, Blinkit is ahead with a 46% market share, over Zepto's 29% and Swiggy Instamart's 25%. Zomato also boasts more monthly transacting users, at 20 million, versus Swiggy's 14 million."
Avantika: "So, what are Zomato's key differentiators then? What makes them stand out in such a crowded field?"
Hrishikesh: "Well, for one, their extensive restaurant network and first-mover advantage, built over 15 years. They also have a truly diversified revenue model now, including Hyperpure for B2B supplies, their cloud kitchens, and this expanding 'going-out' business with District and live events. That's a huge advantage beyond just food delivery. And of course, their heavy reliance on AI for personalization, delivery efficiency, and customer recommendations is a key differentiator. The success of Zomato Gold and their strong brand recognition, combined with their commitment to sustainability, all contribute to their strong market position."

Avantika: "So, from an investment perspective, Hrishikesh, what are the key highlights for Zomato right now?"
Hrishikesh: "I'd say their market dominance in both food delivery and quick commerce in India is a major highlight, showing strong network effects. Then, their proven path to profitability, with impressive adjusted EBITDA and PAT in FY24, signals a sustainable business. The robust growth trajectory, with 56% YoY revenue growth and strong analyst projections, is very compelling. And, of course, their strategic diversification into the 'going-out' segment and the success of Zomato Gold definitely create multiple growth engines. The $1 billion institutional funding also reinforces strong investor confidence."
Avantika: "Exactly. And here are the key risks to consider for our listeners. Firstly, that recent leadership instability with several key executives stepping down does raise questions about succession and execution. Secondly, despite their lead, the intense competitive pressure from Swiggy and others in both food delivery and quick commerce could lead to margin compression. We also can't ignore the general slowdown in the food delivery sector, which might impact growth rates. Integration challenges from large acquisitions like Paytm's events business could be resource-intensive, and despite being cleared by the CCI, Zomato's market position means continued regulatory scrutiny is always a factor."

Avantika: "For our listeners on Let's Venture, Zomato is definitely one to watch. It's a company that has not only achieved market leadership but also demonstrated a clear path to profitability and is actively diversifying its revenue streams. The opportunities are significant."
Hrishikesh: "Whether you invest or not, understanding Zomato's strategic moves, its market dominance, and how it navigates these competitive and leadership challenges is valuable for anyone looking at the Indian consumer tech landscape. It truly reflects the dynamic nature of our startup ecosystem."
